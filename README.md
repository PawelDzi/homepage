## About me
Hi i'm Paweł and I'm currently working in uniformed services. Same time ago I found a course "YouCode" and decided change my job. I'm not satisfied with what I'm doing in my life. I need a big change, so that's why I'm here. I used to like code when I went to school. I think I was good at it. In future I want to expand my knowledge and be a Frontend developer.

## Languages
